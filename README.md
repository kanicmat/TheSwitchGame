This game uses combinational logic to detect when the user flips the correct and incorrect switches, determine which led should be on, and display the player’s score and the timer on the 7-segment display. The game uses sequential logic to store and update the users score, control the game timer, and control the prompt randomization. 

When the game starts, the LEDs  above random switches will light up indicating that the user must flip these switches to gain points. Users will have 20 seconds to flip as many switches as they can and achieve as high of a score as possible. Each correct flip receives 1 point, and an incorrect switch results in the game ending. If the user makes it to the end of the count down, all LEDs turn on, their score will remain visible and the timer will stay at 0 until the reset button is pressed. When the reset button is pressed the whole board resets, meaning that the users score, and the timer will reset to their initial values of 0 and 20 respectively. Additionally, if the game ends because of the user flipping the incorrect switch, the game can be reset using the reset button, which in this case will override the stop timer case and reset the high score and timer to their original values.
